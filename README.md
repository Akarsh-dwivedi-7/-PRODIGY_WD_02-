Stopwatch Web Application
Welcome to the Stopwatch Web Application repository! This project is a fully functional stopwatch built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was developed as part of Task 2 during my internship with Prodigy Infotech. The application provides a clean and interactive user interface with real-time tracking of hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

‚ú® Features
‚Ä¢Real-Time Tracking: Accurately displays time in the format HH:MM:SS:MS.

‚Ä¢Interactive Controls:

‚ó¶Start: Begins the stopwatch.

‚ó¶Stop: Pauses the stopwatch.

‚ó¶Reset: Resets the stopwatch to 00:00:00:00.

‚Ä¢Modern UI Design: Clean and visually appealing interface with smooth animations.

‚Ä¢Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on all screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

‚Ä¢Accessibility: Includes aria-label attributes for better accessibility.

üé® Design Highlights
‚Ä¢Animations:

‚ó¶Fade-in animation for the heading.

‚ó¶Slide-in animation for the container.

‚ó¶Pulse animation for the time display.

‚Ä¢Hover Effects: Buttons scale slightly on hover for better interactivity.

‚Ä¢Color Scheme:

‚ó¶Green for Start button.

‚ó¶Red for Stop button.

‚ó¶Blue for Reset button.

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
‚Ä¢The stopwatch uses JavaScript's Date.now() method to calculate elapsed time.

‚Ä¢The setInterval function updates the display every 10 milliseconds for precision.

‚Ä¢The time is formatted to always display two digits for hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds using padStart.

üìÇ Repository Structure
‚Ä¢index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the stopwatch.

‚Ä¢style.css: The CSS file for styling and animations.

‚Ä¢script.js: The JavaScript file for functionality and logic.
